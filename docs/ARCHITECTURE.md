# Architecture

- Tri-cycle cooperative model: A -> B -> C -> release, repeated until convergence.
- Lane A: preprocessing & stabilization; Lane B: entanglement, routing, constraints; Lane C: decision & verification.
- Interposer: photonic bus simulation for time/phase lock, loss, and jitter; deterministic handoffs.
- Shifting firewall: rotating defense across timing, routing, keys, syndromes, and RF windows; reverse rollback on anomaly.
- Thermal dispersion: segmented flexium sectors (PGS primary, graphene/PI overlays, copper mesh patches) with independent exits.
- Serviceability: three cartridges, kinematic seats, ground-first interlocks, immutable provenance seals.
