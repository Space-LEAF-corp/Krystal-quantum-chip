# Validation Plan (10 years)

- Year-1 hardening: accelerated daily/weekly/monthly cadence with shifting firewall, red-team campaigns, fault injection, swap cycles.
- Metrics: handoff integrity >= 99%, jitter <= 1 ns, haze <= 0.5% equivalent (optical proxy), ΔT reduction >= 30% at hot-spots, cross-lane ΔT <= 1°C.
- Reliability: MTBF/MTTR dashboards, drift analysis, convergence plateaus, acceptance bands for release confidence.
- Years 2–10: scale, specialization, operational reliability, end-of-life and archival integrity.
