# Governance and Provenance

- Hardware IDs: QR/NFC placeholders with custody chain entries.
- Immutable logs: Telemetry digests signed per release window; lane-local state ledgers merged at pass boundaries.
- Repair rights: Encoded in provenance; swap events require custody update.
- Firmware policy: Staged updates with canaries; auto-rollback on anomaly; secure boot of timing schemas/firewall sequences.
